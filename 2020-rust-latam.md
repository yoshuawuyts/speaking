# CFP Rust Latam

- Title: Tide & Surf
- Tags: intermediate / advanced
- Language: EN (though considering doing ES; native speaker, but never
presented about tech in ES before -- might want to)

## Abstract

## Committee Details

## Committee Pitch

Between 2018-2019 I was the co-lead of the Rust Net WG, which subsequently
became the Rust Async Ecosystem WG. Much of the work we did was research ways
to make asynchronous Rust more accessible to people. And async-std, tide, and
surf are the products of much of the work that happened in that time period.

## Why are you excited?

Rust is at a turning point in adoption. Now that we have Rust 2018,
async/await, and well-known production users, we're seeing an shift from
enthusiasts to industry adoption.

There's still a perception that "rust is hard" and especially "async rust is
hard". We're here to show what *could be*. How through careful API design,
documentation, and yielding Rust's strenghts we can actually produce
something that's *easier* than the alternatives.

I don't feel this is a take that many people bring to Rust; but it's such an
important part of what makes the language work. I'd like to share that
perspective with more people, empowering people to realize *they too* can
make these things, and in turn help lower the barrier for everyone else.

## Previous speaking experience

I've spoken at over 40 events in the past 4 years, helped out at workshops,
and run livestreams. Highlights include:

- NodeFest Japan 2016
- NodeConf EU 2017
- RustConf 2019

## Have you presented on this topic before?

I've spoken at-length about JavaScript frameworks in the past. This would be
the first time I present publicly about the work we've done on Tide, Surf,
and our HTTP stack.
