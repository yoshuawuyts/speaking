# Designing Tide

## Elevator Pitch (300 chars)

For the past two years I've been working on the Tide server framework. I'd
love to do a talk on the design considerations, and place it in the larger
context of design considerations that arise around async Rust. Design talks
are rare, and I would love to give one.

API design is both crucial and under-represented. The Tide webserver has been 

## Description

Async networking in Rust is taking off. But one challenge in particular is
how to make async Rust available to existing and new Rustaceans alike.

In this talk Yosh will walk you through the design of Tide, a friendly HTTP
server â€” using it as a case study for effective async API design in Rust.

## Notes

I'm the former co-lead of the Async Ecosystem WG, current member of the Async
Foundations WG, co-designer of async-std, and co-designer of the Tide
framework. Much of my work in the past few years has been focused on async
Rust, and I would love to give a talk on API design in the context of Async
Rust.

## Bio

Yosh is a Rust engineer at [Prisma](https://prisma.io). Currently active as a
member of the Rust Async Foundations WG and co-creator of Tide and async-std.
