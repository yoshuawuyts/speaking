# Go! Go! Nanoframeworks!

Ok, let's try a thing. Close your eyes for a bit. No peeking. Now I want you to
imagine the last time you wrote some browser code. Perhaps a component of
sorts.  Remember what that was like?  yeah. Ok. Now I want you to imagine that
was the very last time you had to write that component. New framework in town?
No problem, still works. Wouldn't that be nice?

What if I told you that's possible today? That we have the means to create
browser agnostic 100% native DOM elements. And an increasing array of
frameworks that have all the conveniences you've come to expect but without
locking you in. Sounds almost too good to be true right? It's real though; v.
real.

This talk will show how to code up a modern application framework using browser
primitives. It'll show how to create native DOM diffing, building and
optimizing a UI loop, creating a message bus, and explaining which APIs to use
to optimize application booting. All of which should continue to work as long
as we got browsers to run them on, which is most likely gonna be a whole while
longer ✌️

Oh PS. Expect live coding. Or a workshop if you like. Maybs even both (:
