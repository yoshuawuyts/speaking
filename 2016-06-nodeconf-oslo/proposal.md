# tiny messages for big architectures
Imagine a world where upgrading applications is seamless; where there are no
gaps between the architecture that serves your first few users to the system
that powers a million.

Using `nanomsg`'s scalability protocols, seamless architecture becomes reality.
In his talk Yosh will explain the philosophy of `nanomsg` and the patterns it
employs to reliably architect software that scales.

-----------------
## A little bit more
As a contractor most projects I've encountered have been built as monoliths,
requiring great effort to refactor and unwrap into different services. I found
there is usually a great divide between the initial (JS) application and the
system that must be run on a cluster. Based on my experience I would like to
talk about how, from the start of a project, scaling issues like this can be
avoided.

In this talk I'll demonstrate how the nanomsg sockets can be integrated into
Node.js for both in-process and (networked) inter-process communication. At the
end of the talk the audience should have a good understanding of the ideas
underlying nanomsg, an overview of staple architecture patterns and the right
resources to investigate further.

## About
I'm a freelance software engineer who's been an active member of the Node.js
community for a while. Apart from in-house training I've done a [fair amount of
public speaking](https://github.com/yoshuawuyts/talks) and been involved with
numerous [nodeschool](https://github.com/nodeschool) events in multiple
cities :herb:
