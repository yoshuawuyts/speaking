LETS BUILD A PEER TO PEER SYSTEM!

#### Description
Ever wondered how peer to peer systems are implemented? In this talk we'll go
over how to implement a fully functional data exchange service from first
principles custom tailored for people new to the field. We'll go from a tiny
system with two nodes, up to something that can work at internet scale.  We'll
be touching on architecture, data structures, networking and more. At the end
of it you'll feel good about you, your coding abilities and your ability to p2p
in particular.

#### Learning objectives
- basic data structures used in p2p (mostly how kademlia works)
- an idea of which protocols are used in p2p, and why
- feel confident you can peer to peer too :v:

DIY VIRTUAL DOM IN 20 MINUTES!

#### Description
Ever wondered what goes on inside today's framework engines? In this talk
we'll got over how to implement a virtual DOM, from scratch. We'll start off
with some of the basics around why DOM virtualization is useful; gently moving
up to how to create nodes, how to implement diffing, array reordering and
eventually dive into some of the less understood optimizations such as branch
caching. All packaged up neatly into a 20 minute talk.

#### Learning objectives
- get an idea of why virtual DOMs are used
- understand how node diffing works
- understand which optimizations can be applied after basic diffing
- basically we're going to demistify this whole vdom thing once and for all
  because it's definitely time we did. Everyone uses these things and so few
  people seem to understand how it works and that's not a good thing
