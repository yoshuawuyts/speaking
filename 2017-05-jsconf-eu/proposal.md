# Go! Go! Nanoframeworks!

What happens if the right tool for the job is one you built - 10 years ago.
In today's browser world it seems almost unheard of to build code that will
last a decade. That doesn't necessarily need to be the case though.

This talk will show how to code up a modern application framework using browser
primitives. It'll show the how to create native DOM diffing, creating and
optimizing a UI loop, creating a message bus, and explaining which APIs to
use to optimize application booting. All of which should still be applicable in
web landscape of tomorrow.
